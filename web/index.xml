Isolated web features within a single ASP.NET Core service # We&amp;rsquo;ve been discussion recently at work how we can increase our velocity for the team. I went to think and saw that a lot of new projects have a high upfront cost when it comes to provisioning the resources, setting up the build and deployment pipelines, etc. This is fine for longer running projects but would be delaying quick experiments much more than it should.</description></item><item><title>2.

Short guide to experimentation # Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in running an experiment at work and decided to dive a bit deeper into all the different parts of how to get it set up. You can find a lot of articles online which talk very vaguely about how to run an experiment. This post is meant to be a cheat sheet of sorts to give you a step by step of what is needed, but at the same time it won&amp;rsquo;t cover the topic very in depth.</description></item></channel></rss>
