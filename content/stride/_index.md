# Stride

I'm a contributor to the [Stride](https://www.stride3d.net/) game engine. It's open source, it's C# - I love it.

Stride is a huge code base with over 100 projects and many users all over the world with a variety of needs.
My main area of contribution looks at core libraries, serialization system, asset pipeline and also the plugin architecture.
