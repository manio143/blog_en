# IQA Management Hub

You may not have heard about it, but there's a sport called quadball, formerly known as quidditch.
I discovered it when I was in highschool, got really into it.
But obviously sport is not just the players. It's referees, team managers, league organizers.
So at some point I decided to volunteer for the IQA - International Quadball Association.
And my favorite capacity of volunteering is as a software engineer.

IQA doesn't have a lot needs for a big team of programmers.
They run a website with news blog posts and a service called Management Hub.
It's a single place for admins of National Governing Bodies (country members of IQA) to provide official statistics to the IQA and a referee hub for certifying referees.

So at the moment of writing I'm the one maintaining it.

And as I set off in my role I decided I don't want to do any rewrites, just keep the existing codebase alive.
Easier said than done. It was written in ruby on rails and it's cool.
BUT I can't spend the time to learn ruby in depth to migrate to a newer version where a lot of things will break.
AND I like C# a lot. So I'm going to try to rewrite this site into ASP.NET Core and try to fix a lot of issues that piled up over time.
