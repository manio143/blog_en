# Excos

I've started a new project. The concept is as follows: services and clients need configuration. Changes in software version or in configuration version can have an impact on the observed metrics. We should be validating changes as we make them. Excos is a configuration, observability and experimentation platform which aims to enable safe software changes.

It's going to be an open source project which could potentially be turned into a SaaS offering later on. To be notified of the development efforts subscribe on <https://excos.dev>
