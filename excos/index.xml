 1. Simple CI/CD pipeline
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#1-simple-cicd-pipeline">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before I start writing code for a new project I want to set up a very simple pipeline for getting it deployed.
I decided to use Docker containers as means of packaging the app since they offer a lot of simplicity once built.
If I was using a cloud platform for running containers it would likely come with some deployment system and a GitHub integration.
But I want to keep this project fairly low cost for now. Instead of using a big cloud provider I&amp;rsquo;m renting a small VPS for 8 euro a month.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3.

 3. Implementing privacy compliance

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the modern internet everyone and their mother is collecting data about users.
And to be fair, I also want to collect some for legitimate reasons - making a better product and a better experience to my users.
But because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of nefarious actors out there we now have regulations in place that explicitly require services to provide users with more control over their data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
